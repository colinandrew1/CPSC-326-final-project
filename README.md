## CPSC 326: Organization of Programming Languages Final Project  
This project adds a __Mark and Sweep Garbage Collector__ to the MyPL programming language that has been developed over the course of the semester.  
The only file that required changing was the mypl_vm.file. All files needed to use the MyPL programming language are provided in the root of this repository.  
Unit tests for the garbage collector are available in project_tests.py and example programs are provided in /examples  
The slides used in the [video presentation](https://youtu.be/al9EwCIbGuc) are available in CPSC Final Project.pdf.
